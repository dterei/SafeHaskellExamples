Newtype deriving is broken in that it allows otherwise undefinable functions to
be defined. It allows casting between say 'm Int' to 'm t' where t is a newtype
such that t ~ Int. This can break type safety allowing a type of 'm t' to be
passed to a function that expects 'm Int' or visa-versa. When combined with
things like GADTs and type families that allow type level programming (so a
type 'm Int' may have a completely different concrete representation than 'm t'
[e.g 'm Int' doesn't actually need to involve 'Int' values]) we have a problem.

I haven't been able to find a really nice example of module boundaries being
broken (the most obvious case of security problems). But do have lots of cases
of how it is currently unsound and breaks the Haskell type system. This is
enough evidence but not the most compelling.

Wait, Y_Main, Y1 sort of does. Y1 exposes a set API that should only allow a
list of elements above a certain minimum initial element. Using newtype
deriving we can define an isomorphic type to Int but redefine Ord so its
reversed.  This would be fine since the types are different but we can also use
new type deriving to convert between Int and the newtype so after the list has
been created we use this to convert the min list of newtypes to a list of
Int's. This list of Int's breaks the invariants of the list which shouldn't be
possible with exposed API.
