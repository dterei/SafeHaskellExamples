The idea is to use typeable to perform unsafe
casts between types.

-------

 - Since Typeable only operates on types (and ignores values/constructors)
   we can define a standalone deriving instances for Typeable even when we
   don't have access to all the constructors for the type.
 - We can still restrict access to the class method, 'typeOf'.
