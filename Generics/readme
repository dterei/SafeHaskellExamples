The idea is to use Generic deriving to get a
serilization of a data type and use that to
inspect and potentially construct values of
private types.

Don't seem to be able to define instances for data
types that haven't exported all their constructors.
So I guess we are OK? (i.e same result as stand
alone deriving)
